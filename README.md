## Play Session

The user starts the story by clicking the START button. The story begins and the player's personna is explained first and the storyteller (which is an LLM agent) will start the story. The storyteller will prompt the player for actions (2 to 3 propositions) and the player will be able to choose one of them. The storyteller will then continue the story based on the player's action. The storyteller will also explain his thoughts and feelings about the story and the player's action. The story ends when the storyteller decides it's over or the player clicks on the END button.
